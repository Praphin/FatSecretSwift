# Swift FatSecret REST API
Implementation of FatSecret REST API.

Not all API calls are implemented just the basic ones (food.search & food.get). This is more for an understanding on how to sign the correct signature and get a successful response. I built this for a side project I was working on that needed to access data about foods. Codable objects are also used if you are interested in that too!

You will need to add your own keys. Please let me know if anything doesn't work as it should.

*Uses Cocoapods for CryptoSwift
